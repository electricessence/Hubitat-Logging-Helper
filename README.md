# Logging Helper Library for Hubitat

## Overview

The **Logging Helper** library provides a simple, consistent way to handle logging within Hubitat drivers and apps. It allows you to manage log levels and provides convenient methods for logging messages at various levels (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`). This library helps in keeping your code clean and your logs informative.

## Features

- **Log Level Management**: Easily control what level of logs are generated by your driver or app.
- **Flexible Logging**: Support for both string messages and closures, ensuring that logs are only generated when necessary.
- **Customizable**: Set the default log level and adjust log output to suit your debugging needs.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Include the Library**:
   ```groovy
   #include Electrified.LoggingHelper
   ```

2. **Set Up Log Levels**:
   - Ensure your driver or app has a `logLevel` preference, typically an `enum` with values like `debug`, `info`, `warn`, and `error`.

   Example:
   ```groovy
   preferences {
       input(
           name: 'logLevel',
           type: 'enum',
           title: 'Log Level',
           description: 'Select the desired level of logging.',
           options: ['debug', 'info', 'warn', 'error'],
           defaultValue: 'warn',
           required: true
       )
   }
   ```

3. **Log Messages**:
   - Use the provided methods to log messages at the appropriate levels.
   ```groovy
   logDebug "This is a debug message."
   logInfo "This is an info message."
   logWarn "This is a warning."
   logError "This is an error message."
   ```

   - You can also pass a closure if the message construction is expensive or conditional.
   ```groovy
   logDebug { "This message is only constructed if debug logging is enabled: ${text}" }
   ```
